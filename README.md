# Vagrant / Chef Configurations v1.1

Everything that one needs to create development environments with Vagrant and Chef.

This repo is very much a work in progress. There are many things that can be improved. Annotations were made in comment form within the example Vagrantfile, regarding room for improvement. Issues and pull-requests are encouraged.

### Features Include

- LAMP (PHP 5.4)
- Git
- Composer
- PHPUnit
- automatic MySQL database creation
- automatic apache vhost creation
- other cookbooks and ready for love (ElasticSearch)

# Installation

These instructions are merely one way to use these tools. I'm presenting them because I feel that they're both reasonable and simple.

These are instructions for creating a development environment utilizing Vagrant for virtual-machine management and Chef for installing and configuring software.

You would install this individually into each site repo. When working on a site, you'd bring up the server. When you're done, you suspend it. I repeat. Each individual site repo has its own virtual-machine that is brought up when you're working on that specific site, and then suspended when you're done.

This should work on any Windows, OSX, or Linux box.

### First, install the applications.

**(DO NOT INSTALL FROM PACKAGE MANAGER)** If you do install virtualbox, vagrant or chef from package managers then expect pain.

- [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- [install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

- [Install Chef Client](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/)

### Now, set up your project.

1. Add this repository to yours.

```
cd mysite

git submodule add git@github.com:ShawnMcCool/vagrant-chef.git
```


2. Update the submodules within the submodule. (inception)

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Copy an example Vagrantfile to your project's root.

```
cp vagrant-chef/vagrant/vagrantfiles/Vagrantfile .
```

4. Read the Vagrant file and modify where appropriate for your project.

5. Add this entry to hosts file

```
10.10.10.10 app.local
```

# Workflow

### Start the Application

	$ vagrant up

Wait until Vagrant / Chef are done. Then, in your browser hit http://app.local.

### Stop the Application

You have the choice of either... supending the application (takes a small bit more disk space). **Recommended**

	$ vagrant suspend

or.. you can halt the box. (saves like 200meg?) But, because next time you start it up again it'll take a long time.

	$ vagrant halt

### When making changes to the environment...

If configurations change you can simply run:

	$ vagrant reload

It will then apply your changes to the Vagrantfile or cookbooks.

### Easing the pain

Ok, it's not really that painful in exchange for what you get from it. I add these aliases to my shell script's initialization file for ease. You might like them, too.

    alias vl="VBoxManage list runningvms"
    alias vu="vagrant up"
    alias vd="vagrant suspend"
    alias vr="vagrant reload"
    alias vs="vagrant ssh"
    alias ga="git add ."
    alias gc="git commit -a"
    alias gp="git push"

### Troubleshooting

There is a known Mac issue with VirtualBox crashing your VMs. [Here are more details and the solution.](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11649)

### How you can help!

I've made many annotations of issues in the Vagrantfile example, each could use a solution.

Trying to install this on your system and reporting back any issues that you've had with instructions listed would be a huge help.

Know a bit about Vagrant / Chef and want to complain that something could be done better? Please open an issue!
